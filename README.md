**Oct. 3rd**
The first thing we did go over the Learning Outcomes form one final time before I turned it in. Afterwards, Mr. Beuer started providing context for the archived documents I would be working with. They are associated with the Chruch Assistance Fund which was part of the diocese but considered a separate corporation, a bit like a bank. My task of the day was pretty straight forward, I was given four folders and I need to organize them into two general groups, Financial or Governance documents. I was also given the option to additionally work on a collection donated by the Rev. Laura Cameron Fraser, they were materials regarding the ordination of women in the Episcobal Church. I was told they consisted of fliers, newsclipings and other materials that pertained to that topic and it has never been organized. Despite my interest I was worried about taking on too much on my first day so i decline. I was also offred a collection called the Chrisello Papers, some kind of national organization associated with the diocese but I decline that too. I wanted to start with something simple and small so I could get my bearings and understand how the processing and reprocessings worked. According Mr. Beuer processing and reprosseing are two sides of the same coin, there are rounds of apprisal and once that is finished you have to decide how you want the information to be organized. You also have to think about what can be subdivided and if there is a better order to doing things. There are hundreds of different ways to put a collection together and one thing to consider is what the story is for this person or organization and how do I tell that through the records that have been left behind. It's an ever evolving puzzle until you make the finding aid. 
I got to work and started going folder by folder to assess the contents, not putting anything into piles yet just looking at the documents and surveying what was there. After that I began sorting which ones I believed belonged to either the Goverance or the Financial folders I was putting together. I did ask questions to make sure that I understand what documents would belong in each (particulalry the Governance documents) and Mr. Beuer gave me a few exmaples such by-laws, Articles of Incorporation, property deeds, etc. I also made sure that I organized not only by those two categories but also by date to keep everything organized and cohensive. I ended up making a third folder because there were a lot of correspondence documents that could fall into either category, so I decided to put them all together by date and handle them next week. I was recommended a resource to look into called DACS (Describing Archives: A Content Standard) on my own time and next week Mr. Beuer says we will be talking about the two theories of original order.
