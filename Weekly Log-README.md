**Oct. 3rd**
We first went over the Learning Outcomes form one final time before I turned it in. Afterward, Mr. Bauer provided context for the archived documents I would be working with. They are associated with the Chruch Assistance Fund, which was part of the diocese but considered a separate corporation, a bit like a bank. My task of the day was pretty straightforward. I was given four folders and needed to organize them into two general groups: Financial and Governance documents. I also had the option to work on a collection donated by the Rev. Laura Cameron Fraser; they were materials regarding the ordination of women in the Episcopal Church. It consisted of fliers, news clippings, and other materials that pertained to that topic, and it had never been organized. Despite my interest, I was worried about taking on too much on my first day, so I declined. I was also offered a collection called the Chrisello Papers, a national organization associated with the diocese, but I declined that, too. I wanted to start with something simple and small to get my bearings and understand how the processing and reprocessings worked. According to Mr. Bauer, processing and reprocessing are two sides of the same coin. There are rounds of appraisal, and once that is finished, you have to decide how you want the information to be organized. You also have to think about what can be subdivided and if there is a better order you can use. There are hundreds of different ways to assemble a collection, and one thing to consider is what the story is for this person or organization. How do I tell that through the records that have been left behind? It's an ever-evolving puzzle until you make the finding aid. 
I got to work and started going folder by folder to assess the contents, not putting anything into piles yet, just looking at the documents and surveying what was there. After that, I began sorting which ones I believed belonged to either the Goverance or the Financial folders I was putting together. I asked questions to ensure I understood what documents would belong in each (particularly the Governance documents), and Mr. Beuer gave me a few examples such as by-laws, Articles of Incorporation, property deeds, etc. I also ensured that I organized by those two categories and by date to keep everything organized and cohesive. I ended up making a third folder because there were a lot of correspondence documents that could fall into either category, so I put them all together by date and decided to handle them next week. Mr. Bauer recommended a resource to look into called DACS (Describing Archives: A Content Standard) on my own time, and next week, Mr. Beuer says we will be talking about the two theories of original order.

**Oct. 10th**
Today was very satisfying. First, Mr. Bauer went over my work, and I explained my thought process and how I organized everything into the two groups. I explained that the documents I chose for the governance file were because although collectively they all had to do with the donations and the Church Assistance Fund, some of them only mentioned it in passing as correspondence or were articles of association or incorporation. They are tangentially related to financials, but I felt the connection was not direct enough for them to go into the Financial folder. I also went over items I was unsure how to categorize, and Mr. Bauer gave me some historical context which informed my decision. They were documents titled "State of Washington," and apparently, they are associated with a diocese member named James F. Hodges. He made a fortune in the post-war housing boom, enabling him to work for the diocese for free, which is why it is in such good financial shape. With his business acumen, he started an investment fund for the church and was involved in funds like the one I was working on. I did have a question about how documents like these should be arranged chronologically because I noticed some of the official documents would be dated one with when they were written or drawn up and then given another date for when they were officially signed. Mr. Bauer explained that every archivist handles this differently, and he personally went by the date when things are signed, but it was up to me to decide what would work for me. In the end, I went with when documents were officially created.
Another point we went over was how staples, rubbers, and paperclips always need to be gently removed. The reason being that they can cause damage to the documents if left unattended for long periods; for example, paper clips can rust, which can cause paper to corrode. It also can cause the pages to have a warp, and it did not help that many of the pages were extremely thin (onion paper, as Mr. Bauer calls it). He said it was essential to consider whether everything should stay together or if what I was organizing needed to be further broken down and interfiled. Lastly, as promised, Mr. Bauer discussed the two theories of original order; jokingly, he called it the wrong way and the right way. For "the right way," when items are donated, the order in which they are contained (inside a box, a folder, etc.) is the order in which the archivist will arrange and process documents. The "wrong way" or "other way" was what I did last week, examining the contents and sorting like items in an order that made sense to me, a bit more of a traditional approach. However, a single file cannot hold everything; the information inside needed to be broken down, which was my task for the day. I had to take these two large files that I made and break them down into smaller pieces. Mr. Bauer gave me an example of how I might do that with financial records like mine, and I kept that in mind as I began my task. After our conversation, I got to work on creating subfolders. It took a few hours, and while looking through them, I made sure that I carefully removed any staple, clip, or metal piece holding papers together. I kept everything chronological and created subfolders for specific document types. For Governance, I made files for State of Washington documents, Unsorted Governance Documents, Certificates of Organization, Certificates of Amendment, Articles of Association, Notices, Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws, and Minutes of the Meeting. For Financial, I made: Unsorted Financial Documents, Banking, Mortgage Forms, and Financial Correspondence.

**Oct. 17th**
I reviewed the new subfolders I made for the collection last week with Mr. Bauer. I was feeling a bit ill, so I could not stay as long as I would have liked, but I am glad I got feedback on my work. I was told I did a good job, but I expressed my confusion with some of the documents I had placed in the unsorted files (i.e., promissory notes and a bank book) because I was still determining where they would go. Luckily, Mr. Bauer explained what those unsorted documents were, which will be helpful as we move forward. I had an excellent discussion with Mr. Bauer about archives. Typically, we expect them to be neat and organized all the time and for everything to easily fall into place, but that's not the case. An organized archive does not happen automatically; there will be times when the dates do not add up, documents do not fit neatly into one category, or context is lost. Archives are not inherently perfect because people are not perfect, and in the end, we can only do our best to maintain it all. Also, I have been informed that it is completely fine for an entire series to have a folder with one thing in it. I also need to be more careful with correspondences; I did fine with them but was concerned I was getting them mixed up. Mr. Bauer informed me that when in doubt, consider who the correspondence is being sent to and the content matter; whether or not the content of the letter is explicitly about finances or governance or if they are only mentioned in passing, a slight distinction but an important one.
Most importantly, Mr. Bauer told me that when all is said and done, I have to do what I think is best for the collection and help provide context for the collection. In comparison, there are larger things to be concerned about when it comes to archiving, like budgeting, keeping track of reference requests, pulling requests, etc. Lastly, we delved into the ethical rules of archiving today, what assisting in research is like, and how that may differ from a library. Mr. Bauer stressed that it is essential that an archivist DO NOT influence the research or interpret the documents for the researcher. It is our job to help find the answers people need, not the ones they want while respecting restrictions that may be placed on certain records at the behest of donors. I was advised to peruse the documents again (which I did) and told that we would be going over Preservica next week.

**Oct. 24th**
Before we began for the day, Mr. Bauer and I went over the processing plan and some of my questions regarding it. I wanted to make sure I did it correctly, especially when it came to describing the condition of the collection; Mr. Bauer even recommeneded a book on condition reporting I should check out when I have the time. Overall, the things I need to keep an eye out for are tearing, foxing, yellowing of the pages, photos and pages sticking together, etc. It will be helpful in creating a finding aid and it also lets an archivsit know if something needs to be seen by a conservator or needs further preservation. I noticed that the collection did have a bit of yellowing and some tearing so I marked it down. Mr. Bauer went on to explain the difference between paper, records and collections. Papers refer to individuals, records refer to businesses, corporations, non-profits and organizations of that naturel and collections are often materials are taken from different places and briniging them together so they do not have one provenance, they have multiple. Mr. Bauer was quick to point out though that these are generalities and that there are exceptions. In my case, what I was working with was a considered a record, because they all come from the same source. We also had a serious discussion about the difference between abandoned property and found-in-collection when I asked about the acquistion information in my processing plan. In the museum and library profession, found-in-collection means you have it in the collection but do not know how you got it, there's no paperwork nor a way to tell how it got there. Abandoned property is when you know where it comes from (i.e. could be loaned) but no one comes to pick it up and may be rediscovered after a period of time. Every state has there own set of laws addressing this issue. It only escalates to the federal level if the property are human remains and when that happens NAGRA (Native American Grave and Repatriation Act) may get involved. In Washington State, abandoned proprty is not owned by the library collection or museum it belongs to someone, however there is a process in place where abandoned property can become there's. 

Next, we got to work on Preservica, which was exciting! Mr. Bauer explained that it is a digital asset managment database (or a DAM database as Mr. Bauer likes to call it)  and it is for born-digital and digitized materials. He showed me how to use it (i.e., uploading new items, creating new folders, deleting, how to do a bulk upload etc.) navigate through it. You can use it in conjunction with Excel and it will upload all the metadata and attach it to the correlating files. There aare two options of metadata schema you can work with in Preservica, Dublin Core (DC) and Metadata Objects Descrpition Schema (MODS). You can translate MARC record to DC but not the other way around because there are too many fields and DC does not have the felixbilit. MR. Bauer typically uses MODS when it comes to objects but it can be used for digital records as well. With DC, Preservica will generate what it thinks it needs to describe materials. Since I was going to be using DC, he went through all of the fields in DC that would come up in Preservica and what they meant (i.e. coverage meaning location where material originated from) and the language that would be used in DC (i.e. statements regarding copyright). DC is also a bit simpler to use in comparision to MODS which is probably why today he me using it. After showing me everything Mr. Bauer had me go into Preservica to examine some files, I asked if I could take screenshots and although I could I could not take screenshots of the actual files themselves, otherwise I could break the NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement). This entire time I had to be careful with my photos because some of the information in the files I have been organizing are not for public eyes and considered classified. I was allowed to take pcitures and screenshots of history files, anything that could be found publicly, correspondences, or anything from the Diocesan Council file becasue there was nothing sensitive in it. For the rest of the day I went through the Religious Orders & Other Parishes and Mission Records and the Property files and went through their assests to see if there were any missing fields that could fill/correct or add DC already. This gave me a good opportunity get the lay of the landscape with Preservica and experiemtn with how metadata was added. Next week we will be working with Preservica to continue getting use to it.

Happy Halloween!

**Nov. 7th**
Mr. Bauer was out sick this week. I was asked not to come to the Diocesan House but was given some work to do remotely. Thus, this log will be relatively short. I was tasked to look through files for the Underhill House and then upload them to Preservica. I was instructed to place it under the "Religious Orders & Other Parishes and Missions" pathway. I was permitted to create new files for the documents should I see fit. The folder had business plans, documents about the vision and mission of the house, old to-do lists, and some other miscellaneous files. After a few hours, I concluded that based on how it was already arranged, I had no firm reason to alter the order. I uploaded it and applied Dublin Core so that I may add some metadata to the files.

**Nov 14th**
This week, I spoke with Mr. Bauer about my work with the Underhill House files; he approved my decisions but reminded me that when I add dates, I should input the month as the full name, not the abbreviated version. Today, we took the next step with the collection before we made the finding aid. I had to refolder everything into archival folders and label them appropriately. Mr. Bauer said that when it comes to labeling, every institution does it a little differently; on the left side, he gives a general description of what the file is (i.e., Bylaws Dioceses of Olympian Chruch Assistance Fund), and on the right side is the dates. Dating was pretty straightforward, but there is a certain way it needs to be done if there is a gap in the years. For example, in one file, I had a file that ranged from 1948 to 1974, but rather than express that as "1948-1974, it had to be written as "1948-1951, 1974." this is because there were no documents dated between 1951 to 1974. Once everything was labeled, we would move on to the next step. I had questions about how to label the "State of Washington" documents because I did not think labeling them that way would adequately explain what they were. Hence, Mr. Bauer had me label them "Corporate Founding Documents." When the labeling was done, I had to use the processing plan I had created to organize everything appropriately. Mr. Bauer looked at my plan and noticed a mistake we missed. I needed to switch the order of my Series 1 and Series 2 so that it would be "Series 1: Governance Documents, Series: 2 Financial Documents" and not the other way around as I had it before. Governance should always be first! Mr. Bauer also said never make a subseries if you do not have to and only do it if you absolutely have to. Everything had to be arranged by order of importance; typically, history would be considered the most important in a collection, but since we had nothing like that for this collection, the second most important would be the governance documents and the financials. In the end, my order came down to this:

-Series 1: Governance Documents
  - Corporate Founding Documents
  - Certifcates of Organization
  - Articles of Association
  - Certificate of Amendment
  - Articles of Incorporation
  - Bylaws of Dioceses of Olympian Church Assistance Fund
  - First Meeting and Annual Meeting Minutes
  - Notices
  - Unsorted-Governance Documents
    
-Series 2: Financial Documents
  - Banking Documents
  - Mortgage Forms
  - Promissory Notes
  - Correspondances-Financial Documents
  - Unsorted-Financial Docuements
    
The bylaws file falls where it does in this order because those pertain to how a board is conducted. The certificates and articles deal with the structure of the organization itself. Thus, they have priority. The certificates and articles are kept relative to each other chronologically because the Certificate of Amendment infers that something was changed from the Certificate of Organization, and the articles were created at different points in time. After we reviewed my arrangement, I was given dividers, labeled them Series 1- Governance and Series 2-Financial, and placed them into the box. Before departing, we discussed Dublin Core; I had questions about type, format, and source and wanted to make sure I understood how they differed. I asked if I could continue working on the Underhill files over the Thanksgiving break to add more metadata and continue familiarizing myself with Preservica and Dublin Core. When we return from Thanksgiving, we will create the finding aid, and because we will be gone for a week, I asked if I could come in for extra hours on Friday. Mr.Bauer said he is not typically in on that day of the week; he is usually at St. Mark's but said he could drop by.
