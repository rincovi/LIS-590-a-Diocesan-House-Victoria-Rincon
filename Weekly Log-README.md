**Oct. 3rd**
We first went over the Learning Outcomes form one final time before I turned it in. Afterward, Mr. Bauer provided context for the archived documents I would be working with. They are associated with the Chruch Assistance Fund, which was part of the diocese but considered a separate corporation, a bit like a bank. My task of the day was pretty straightforward. I was given four folders and needed to organize them into two general groups: Financial and Governance documents. I also had the option to work on a collection donated by the Rev. Laura Cameron Fraser; they were materials regarding the ordination of women in the Episcopal Church. It consisted of fliers, news clippings, and other materials that pertained to that topic, and it had never been organized. Despite my interest, I was worried about taking on too much on my first day, so I declined. I was also offered a collection called the Chrisello Papers, a national organization associated with the diocese, but I declined that, too. I wanted to start with something simple and small to get my bearings and understand how the processing and reprocessings worked. According to Mr. Bauer, processing and reprocessing are two sides of the same coin. There are rounds of appraisal, and once that is finished, you have to decide how you want the information to be organized. You also have to think about what can be subdivided and if there is a better order you can use. There are hundreds of different ways to assemble a collection, and one thing to consider is what the story is for this person or organization. How do I tell that through the records that have been left behind? It's an ever-evolving puzzle until you make the finding aid. 
I got to work and started going folder by folder to assess the contents, not putting anything into piles yet, just looking at the documents and surveying what was there. After that, I began sorting which ones I believed belonged to either the Goverance or the Financial folders I was putting together. I asked questions to ensure I understood what documents would belong in each (particularly the Governance documents), and Mr. Beuer gave me a few examples such as by-laws, Articles of Incorporation, property deeds, etc. I also ensured that I organized by those two categories and by date to keep everything organized and cohesive. I ended up making a third folder because there were a lot of correspondence documents that could fall into either category, so I put them all together by date and decided to handle them next week. Mr. Bauer recommended a resource to look into called DACS (Describing Archives: A Content Standard) on my own time, and next week, Mr. Beuer says we will be talking about the two theories of original order.

**Oct. 10th**
Today was very satisfying. First, Mr. Bauer went over my work, and I explained my thought process and how I organized everything into the two groups. I explained that the documents I chose for the governance file were because although collectively they all had to do with the donations and the Church Assistance Fund, some of them only mentioned it in passing as correspondence or were articles of association or incorporation. They are tangentially related to financials, but I felt the connection was not direct enough for them to go into the Financial folder. I also went over items I was unsure how to categorize, and Mr. Bauer gave me some historical context which informed my decision. They were documents titled "State of Washington," and apparently, they are associated with a diocese member named James F. Hodges. He made a fortune in the post-war housing boom, enabling him to work for the diocese for free, which is why it is in such good financial shape. With his business acumen, he started an investment fund for the church and was involved in funds like the one I was working on. I did have a question about how documents like these should be arranged chronologically because I noticed some of the official documents would be dated one with when they were written or drawn up and then given another date for when they were officially signed. Mr. Bauer explained that every archivist handles this differently, and he personally went by the date when things are signed, but it was up to me to decide what would work for me. In the end, I went with when documents were officially created.
Another point we went over was how staples, rubbers, and paperclips always need to be gently removed. The reason being that they can cause damage to the documents if left unattended for long periods; for example, paper clips can rust, which can cause paper to corrode. It also can cause the pages to have a warp, and it did not help that many of the pages were extremely thin (onion paper, as Mr. Bauer calls it). He said it was essential to consider whether everything should stay together or if what I was organizing needed to be further broken down and interfiled. Lastly, as promised, Mr. Bauer discussed the two theories of original order; jokingly, he called it the wrong way and the right way. For "the right way," when items are donated, the order in which they are contained (inside a box, a folder, etc.) is the order in which the archivist will arrange and process documents. The "wrong way" or "other way" was what I did last week, examining the contents and sorting like items in an order that made sense to me, a bit more of a traditional approach. However, a single file cannot hold everything; the information inside needed to be broken down, which was my task for the day. I had to take these two large files that I made and break them down into smaller pieces. Mr. Bauer gave me an example of how I might do that with financial records like mine, and I kept that in mind as I began my task. After our conversation, I got to work on creating subfolders. It took a few hours, and while looking through them, I made sure that I carefully removed any staple, clip, or metal piece holding papers together. I kept everything chronological and created subfolders for specific document types. For Governance, I made files for State of Washington documents, Unsorted Governance Documents, Certificates of Organization, Certificates of Amendment, Articles of Association, Notices, Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws, and Minutes of the Meeting. For Financial, I made: Unsorted Financial Documents, Banking, Mortgage Forms, and Financial Correspondence.

I reviewed the new subfolders I made for the collection last week with Mr. Bauer. I was feeling a bit ill, so I could not stay as long as I would have liked, but I am glad I got feedback on my work. I was told I did a good job, but I expressed my confusion with some of the documents I had placed in the unsorted files (i.e., promissory notes and a bank book) because I was still determining where they would go. Luckily, Mr. Bauer explained what those unsorted documents were, which will be helpful as we move forward. I had an excellent discussion with Mr. Bauer about archives. Typically, we expect them to be neat and organized all the time and for everything to easily fall into place, but that's not the case. An organized archive does not happen automatically; there will be times when the dates do not add up, documents do not fit neatly into one category, or context is lost. Archives are not inherently perfect because people are not perfect, and in the end, we can only do our best to maintain it all. Also, I have been informed that it is completely fine for an entire series to have a folder with one thing in it. I also need to be more careful with correspondences; I did fine with them but was concerned I was getting them mixed up. Mr. Bauer informed me that when in doubt, consider who the correspondence is being sent to and the content matter; whether or not the content of the letter is explicitly about finances or governance or if they are only mentioned in passing, a slight distinction but an important one.
Most importantly, Mr. Bauer told me that when all is said and done, I have to do what I think is best for the collection and help provide context for the collection. In comparison, there are larger things to be concerned about when it comes to archiving, like budgeting, keeping track of reference requests, pulling requests, etc. Lastly, we delved into the ethical rules of archiving today, what assisting in research is like, and how that may differ from a library. Mr. Bauer stressed that it is essential that an archivist DO NOT influence the research or interpret the documents for the researcher. It is our job to help find the answers people need, not the ones they want while respecting restrictions that may be placed on certain records at the behest of donors. I was advised to peruse the documents again (which I did) and told that we would be going over Preservica next week.

**Oct. 24th**
Before we began for the day, Mr. Bauer and I went over the processing plan and some of my questions regarding it. I wanted to make sure I did it correctly, especially when it came to describing the condition of the collection; Mr. Bauer even recommeneded a book on condition reporting I should check out when I have the time. Overall, the things I need to keep an eye out for are tearing, foxing, yellowing of the pages, photos and pages sticking together, etc. It will be helpful in creating a finding aid and it also lets an archivsit know if something needs to be seen by a conservator or needs further preservation. I noticed that the collection did have a bit of yellowing and some tearing so I marked it down. Mr. Bauer went on to explain the difference between paper, records and collections. Papers refer to individuals, records refer to businesses, corporations, non-profits and organizations of that naturel and collections are often materials are taken from different places and briniging them together so they do not have one provenance, they have multiple. Mr. Bauer was quick to point out though that these are generalities and that there are exceptions. In my case, what I was working with was a considered a record, because they all come from the same source.

Happy Halloween!

**Nov. 7th**
Mr. Bauer was out sick this week I was asked to not come in but was given some work to do remotely, thus this log will be relatively short. I was tasked to look through files for the Underhill House, then upload them to Preservica. I was instructed to place it under the "Religious Orders & Other Parishes and Missions" pathway I was given permission to create new files for the documents should I see it fit. The folder had business plans, documents about the vision and mission of the house, old to-do lists and some other miscellanous files. After a few hours I came to the conclusion that based on how it was already arranged I had no firm reason as to why I should alter the order. I uploaded it and applied Dublin Core so I may add some metadata to the files.

This week I spoke with Mr. Bauer about my work with the Underhill House files,
